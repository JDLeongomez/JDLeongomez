Hi, I'm using github to host my personal website ([jdleongomez.info](https://jdleongomez.info/)) created using the [Wowchemy Website Builder](https://wowchemy.com/) for Hugo (previously the Academic theme for Hugo). Please [check it](https://jdleongomez.info/) if you want to know more about me or my work. 

My website is nothing particularly new, but it is a working multilingual example ([English](https://jdleongomez.info/en/) and [Spanish](https://jdleongomez.info/es/)) of a personal academic site created with [Wowchemy Website Builder](https://wowchemy.com/), with a few tweaks. If you are interested, you can check or clone my [personal website repository](https://github.com/JDLeongomez/JDL_website).
